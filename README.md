# Word Guessing Game Consolidation Project

These are rules of Word Guessing Game and how it works:

1. The player is prompted a welcome message at the beginning of the game, a message correlating to the theme of the words (holidays), and the number of letters in the randomly selected word.
2. The player is allowed to guess a letter or a word in every round.
3. The player can guess as many letters as it would like, but only has three word guesses before the game quits.
4. After every round, the game will tell the player how many times the letter appears in the word.
5. When the player guesses the word, it will tell them they are correct, end the game and provide scores.
6. The game will output the number of letters guessed, number of words guessed, and the final score (# of letters guessed).
